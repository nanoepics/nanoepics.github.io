Sanli Faez is among the ten new members of [the Young Academy](https://www.dejongeakademie.nl/). The Young Academy (de Jonge Akademiy in Dutch or DJA) is a dynamic group of active  scientists and scholars in the Netherlands  with outspoken views about science and scholarship and the related policy. They organises inspiring activities for various target groups focusing on interdisciplinarity, science policy, and the interface between science and society. One of the projects I have been involved in and is supported by DJA is the [Climate Helpdesk](https://www.klimaathelpdesk.org).

Here is how Sanli introduces himself and the research in nano-EPics:
