### Upcoming events

* __21-22 January 2021, Veldhoven__

* __21-23 June 2023, Edinburgh__: _Iontronics: from fundamentals to ion-controlled devices Faraday Discussion_,
 

### Past events
* __29 November-1 December 2021, Faraday Discussion (online)__: _Next Generation Nanoelectrochemistry_, Zhu Zhang presented our result on iontornic microscopy of a tungsten microelectrode in this [Faraday Discussions](https://www.rsc.org/events/detail/43016/next-generation-nanoelectrochemistry-faraday-discussion).

* __1-2 July 2021, Utrecht (online)__: _Second IontronicsNL symposium_
In this event, co-organized by Sanli Faez, we covered the basic science required for understanding the wide range of iontronic processes in redox-flow batteries. In collaboration with the UK-RFB network, we also present the latest research results on this rapidly expanding and promising solution for sustainable electrochemical energy storage.

The program consisted of didactic invited lectures and research presentations from the community focused mostly on recent innovative results for Redox-Flow Batteries. More that 90 people attended the openning keynote by Maarten Voors.

* __15 May 2020, Utrecht (online)__: _2nd Utrecht Degrowth Symposium: From circular economy to circular society_,
Together with my colleagues at the [Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/copernicus-institute-of-sustainable-development) and the [Dutch degrowth platform](http://www.ontgroei.nl/) Sanli is organizing this symposium to study and discuss degrowth and circular economy in a multi-disciplinary way. This symposium aims to connect stakeholders from academic and non-academic institutions to discuss holistic societal transformations needed to address the socio-ecological crisis of the 21st century.

* __26-28 May 2020, Erlangen (online)__:  _Workshop on Interferometric Scattering Microscopy_,
Label-free optical imaging and analytical techniques are in high demand in a wide range of applications. Among the various light-matter interactions that can be used for this purpose, elastic scattering is the most fundamental and ubiquitous contrast mechanism. Indeed, several imaging modalities, including bright-field microscopy, dark-field microscopy, phase contrast, DIC, digital holography, interference reflection microscopy, and interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT) have exploited the elastic scattering signal from a wide range of samples. In [this workshop](https://indico.mpl.mpg.de/event/7/overview) organized by the Sandoghdar divistion recent progress and future potentials of elastic scattering with a particular emphasis on interferometric and phase-sensitive methods. 

Nano-EPics will be present with a poster about our recently published method: Electric-Double-Layer-Modulation Microscopy.

* __26 June 2020, The Hague__:  _Netherlands conference on Electrochemical Conversion & Materials (ECCM)_,
Electrochemical conversion is a promising option for long-term storage as this technology is easy scalable to the amount of energy. During the conference the state-of-the-art in science and technology will be shared by international key notes from academia and industry. Dutch scientist and industry representatives will contribute to an appealing parallel programme related to the theme of the conference. During the conference national R&D initiatives related to the ECCM theme will be announced. see [call for abstracts](https://www.co2neutraalin2050.nl/netherlands-conference-on-electrochemical-conversion-26-june-2020/).


* __21-22 January 2020, Veldhoven__: The complete nanoEPics team will be present again at the Physics@Veldhonven conference. The focus session "Iontronics: from nanoscale transport to industrial processes" is organized jointly by Rene van Roij (Institute for Theoretical Physics at UU) and Sanli. The invited speakers to this focus session are Lyderic Bocquet (ENS Paris), Esther Alarcon Llado (AMOLF), Michel Orrit (Leiden), and Serge Lemay (Twente).

* __27-29 November 2019, 1st ECCM Graduate school__:
The main theme of [this school](https://www.co2neutraalin2050.nl/graduateschool2019/) is Electrochemical hydrogen production and CO2 reduction. Bohdan and Zhu are among the selected participants.

* __11 October 2019, Utrecht__:
Esther Alarcon Llado, Rene van Roij, and Sanli organized the [Ionics&IontronicsNL symposium](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/nanophotonics/news-events/iontronicsnl) in Utrecht. 60 scientists from across the Netherlands participated in this event and presented their recent findings. NanoEPics research projects wer presented in four posters by main authors Bohdan, Kevin, Peter, and Zhu. [Prof. Susan Perkin](http://research.chem.ox.ac.uk/susan-perkin.aspx) (Oxford University) presented the keynote lecture.

* __24-26 June 2019, Munich__: Bohdan Yeroshenko presented at the OptoFluidics topical conference of the European Optical Society during The World of Photonic Congress in Munich, Germany. He presented one of the nanoEPics experiments that allows a high-bandwidth measurement of the electrophoretic mobility of a single nanoparticle hold by optical tweezers.

* __22-23 January 2019, Veldhoven__: The complete nanoEPics team will be present at the Physics@Veldhonven conference with two posters and one focus session. The focus session "Nanoscale Sensing" is organized jointly by Peter Zijlstra (TUE) and Sanli. The invited speakers to this focus session are Philipp Kukura (Oxford), Sonia Garcia Blanco (Twente), Gregory Sneider (Leiden), and Martin Baaske (Leiden).

* __4 September 2018, Lausanne__: Sanli presented the seminar _“single particle tracking of electrokinetic flow in nanocapillaries”_ at the bioengineering department at EPFL
* __8-12 October 2018, Delft__: The complete nanoEPics team was present at the EOSAM conference. Peter Speets presented a talk on single particle tracking and Bohdan Yeroshenko presented his result in form of a poster.
